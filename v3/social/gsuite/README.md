- The logo on your services pages is displayed at exactly 320 x 132 pixels; therefore, the recommended image size that you upload is exactly 320 x 132 pixels.
- If you upload a smaller or larger image, the image is resized to exactly 320 x 132 pixels. If the aspect ratio does not match, then the image will be distorted. For example, a 132 x 132 pixel image expands to 320 x 132 pixels, causing distortion.

The docs say 320 x 132 (2.4:1)

The actual element in GMail is 72 x 26 (2.77:1)

Target 320 x 116 (2.77:1)
